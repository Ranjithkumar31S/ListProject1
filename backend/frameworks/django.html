        Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It is designed to help developers create web applications quickly and efficiently by providing a robust set of tools and features.
        Django follows the "batteries-included" philosophy, meaning it comes with many built-in features such as an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping), authentication, and an admin interface.
        It is known for its scalability, security, and ease of use, making it a popular choice for building complex web applications.
