        Bootstrap is a free and open-source front-end framework for designing websites and web applications. It contains CSS- and JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components.
        Bootstrap is designed to make web development faster and easier by providing pre-designed components that can be easily customized.
        It is responsive, meaning it automatically adjusts the layout of web pages to fit different screen sizes, making it ideal for mobile-first design.
