        JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, untyped, and interpreted programming language. It is a core technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.
        JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. It allows developers to implement complex features on web pages, such as dynamic content updates, form validation, and animations.
        JavaScript can be used on both the client-side (in the browser) and server-side (using environments like Node.js).
