        MongoDB is a NoSQL database that uses a document-oriented data model. It stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, which allows for dynamic schemas and easy scalability.
        MongoDB is designed to handle large volumes of data and provides high availability and performance. It is commonly used for applications that require real-time analytics, content management, and big data processing.
        MongoDB supports rich queries, indexing, and aggregation operations, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.       
        It is often used in modern web applications, mobile applications, and data-driven applications due to its flexibility and ease of use.
