        SQLite is a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, and transactional SQL database engine. 
        It is widely used for embedded database systems and is known for its simplicity and efficiency. 
        SQLite is often used in mobile applications, web browsers, and other applications where a lightweight database solution is needed.
